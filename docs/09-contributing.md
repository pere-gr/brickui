# Contributing / Playing With It

Early alpha playground; issues/suggestions welcome.

- Explore `/demos` for examples.
- Open `dist/VanillaBrick.js` or `src/*` to see runtime internals.
- Best way to experiment: write new extensions:
  - pick a `kind`,
  - declare `for` / `requires` / `ns`,
  - wire into events and expose a small public API.
